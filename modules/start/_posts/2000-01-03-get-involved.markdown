The main drivers are [Doug Belshaw](http://twitter.com/dajbelshaw) and [Bryan Mathers](http://twitter.com/BryanMMathers) as part of the work they're doing with the <a href="http://thinkoutloudclub.com">Think Out Loud Club</a> for <a href="http://cityandguilds.com">City & Guilds</a>. It's all being developed in the open (and openly-licensed) so you're very much encouraged to get involved!

The easiest way to get started is to add comments, suggestions, and feedback directly on this site. To do this, look at the top right-hand corner of your screen. You should see some tools that look like an arrow, an eye, and a comment box. 

We're using a free, Open Source annotation layer for the web called [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is). Think of it as being a way to add sticky notes on top of a web page. If you make your comments/replies public, then we can see your suggestions!
