# What's possible with Open Badges?

In this section you'll **earn your first Open Badge and 'push' it to a badge backpack**.

## Earn your first badge

<div style="float:right; padding-left:20px;"><a href="http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/765/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/badge-awareness.png" width="125px" alt="Open Badge awareness badge"></a></div>

One of the best ways to learn how Open Badges work is to earn your first badge! In this section you'll apply for, and hopefully earn, the [Open Badge Awareness badge](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/765/). 

To earn this badge, you'll need to write 250+ words on the following:

* What Open Badges are
* How Open Badges are different from digital badges
* Some ways Open Badges can be used

You can write these words anywhere on the web - so a blog, a wiki, a Facebook page, anywhere with a public URL. It goes without saying you should use your own words, unless you're quoting (which doesn't count towards your 250 words!)
