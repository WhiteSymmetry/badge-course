## Introducing Open Badges

The [Open Badges Infrastucture](http://openbadges.org) is a new online standard to recognize and verify learning. It's backed by [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org), the global non-profit best known for the [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) web browser. Open Badges are information-rich, containing built-in data that links back to the issuer, criteria and verifying evidence.

From the [Badge Alliance](https://www.badgealliance.org/why-badges/) website:

> A digital badge is an online representation of a skill you’ve earned. Open Badges take that concept one step further, and allows you to verify your skills, interests and achievements through credible organizations and attaches that information to the badge image file, hard-coding the metadata for future access and review. Because the system is based on an open standard, earners can combine multiple badges from different issuers to tell the complete story of their achievements — both online and off. Badges can be displayed wherever earners want them on the web, and share them for employment, education or lifelong learning.

Metadata is something we use every day, whether it's tagging someone in a photo on a social network or using the Dewey decimal system in the library. Here's a straightforward definition from [Niso](http://www.niso.org/publications/press/UnderstandingMetadata.pdf) (2004)

> Metadata is structured information that describes, explains, locates, or otherwise makes it easier to retrieve, use, or manage an information resource. Metadata is often called data about data or information about information. (Niso)


## Digital badges

Society has used physical badges for years to display various achievements &mdash; whether it's for sporting achievement or via an organisation such as the Scouting movement. Digital badges are as old as the web, showing status within online communities. Anyone who's used an online forum has seen this in action through the various privileges unlocked through the number of posts members make (or upvotes they receive).

Digital badges are often synonymous with gamification. Companies such as [Foursquare](http://foursquare.com) encouraged users to map locations in various cities by 'checking in' and rating everything from restaurants to parks. Users unlocked digital badges which allowed them to compete against friends and others who were in a similar location. More recently, [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/features/badges) has implemented a digital badging system to scaffold user progress. [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/exercisedashboard) does something similar with their Knowledge Map.

While digital badges can be an extremely effective way to 'gamify' user experience, they lack **transferability**. Users wanting to display their Treehouse, Khan Academy, and Foursquare badges together in one place would have to copy and paste the images. Given that *anyone* could do this, without an audit trail, there is an issue around **trust** and **verifiability**.

As indicated in the quote taken from the Badge Alliance website above, Open Badges take digital badges one step further. They are more suitable to be used as credentials as they have information about the learning experience baked in. Open Badges can be validated by anyone wanting to check up on an individual's claim to knowledge or skills.

Unlike digital badges, users can take their Open Badges can display them anywhere across the web. Open Badges are <em>portable</em> credentials. This works in a similar way to videos from YouTube being embedded on blogs, wikis, and other websites. Collections of badges &mdash; which may feature some from two or more different organisations &mdash; can be displayed in a way that makes sense to the user.

There are several important differences between digital badges and Open Badges:

* **Open Badges are not controlled by any one organisation.** The technology that underpins the whole system (the Open Badges Infrastructure, or OBI) is a free, open-source and run for the world wide community.
* **Open Badges are evidence-based.** The information about who, why, and for what the badge was issued is hard-coded into it as metadata.
* **Open Badges are stackable.** Badges from one organisation's system can build upon ones from another system. This creates a rich ecosystem that individuals can use to build the story of their skills, knowledge, and experience. 
* **Open Badges are transferable.** Badges earned in one environment can be shared in another. Although [Mozilla's badge backpack](http://backpack.openbadges.org) is often used as the default place to send badges, they can be stored anywhere &mdash; including on your own computer, if you prefer.
* **Open Badges put the user in control.** Badges are private until they are published by the user. They provide an easy way to show a portfolio of skills without third parties having to wade through a mountain of data.

The OBI allows any organisation to build upon a secure yet open foundation. Potential **badge issuers** can be assured that the credentials they issue will be displayable anywhere on the web. **Badge earners** gain the advantage of being able to collect and curate their knowledge, skills, and experience from across the web in one place. And **badge 'consumers'** can trust that the badges shown to them can be verified and trusted.
