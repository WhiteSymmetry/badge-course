## How to create an Open Badge proposal

Every organisation works differently. Some will allow you to experiment tomorrow with badges. Others want a fully planned and costed business case. Whatever your situation, it can't hurt to create a simple and straightforward proposal. If not for other people, it will help <em>you</em> understand what you are trying to achieve through your badge(s).

There are many ways you could forumlate this proposal. We're going to use <a href="http://digitalme.co.uk/badgecanvas">DigitalMe's Badge Design Canvas</a> because it's free, easy-to-use, and has been shown in workshop after workshop to produce good results!

The sections are more or less self-explanatory, but you might want some guidance in terms of the <em>order</em> to fill in the boxes. Experience shows that starting with the following boxes quickly leads to positive outcomes:

* Value proposition
* Users
* Skills & knowledge
* Behaviours
* Evidence
* Criteria

It's also worth having a think about what the visual design of the badge would look like. Don't <em>start</em> with this, however, as it can constrain your thinking. You might want to jot down some ideas using the <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">Noun Project</a>, <a href="http://fontawesome.io/icons/">Font Awesome</a>, or even just <a href="http://images.google.com">Google Images</a> for inspiration.
